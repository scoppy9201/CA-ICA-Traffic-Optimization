# CA & ICA Traffic Optimization

This project applies two metaheuristic algorithms — **Cultural Algorithm (CA)** and **Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)** — to solve intelligent transportation optimization problems.

## 📌 Problem Focus
- **CA**: Optimizes the location of public transit hubs (transfer stations).
- **ICA**: Allocates the number of vehicles to bus routes for balanced urban transport.

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📊 Features
- Simulation of evolutionary processes (belief space, empire competition).
- Visualization of optimization progress over generations.
- Data structures for real-world city traffic models.
